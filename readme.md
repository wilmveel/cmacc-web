# Common Accord

This is a proposal on an implementation of common accord.

## Install

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) on your machine.

Clone this project to a folder on your e.g. /home/<user>/common-accord

Go into this folder and run the following command

```
npm install
```

## Usage

to run the electron app 
```sh
./node_modules/.bin/electron .
```

## Principles

+ documents are managed as md files and follow the [markdown spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.24/)
+ accord is an super set of markdown which enables the following features
    + import of documents
    + injection of variables
+ accord works as an preprocessor of mark down. This will follow the same approach as typescript as superset of javascript
